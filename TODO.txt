- modify card feature during testing phase
- go back to previous card that was tested
    - maybe even have it be a large list so you can keep going back in time like how Anki does
- number of dots to display which shows what level of QUALITY one got for answering kinda like how Anki does
- deleted card graveyard revival
- if .ini doesn't exist, allow user to make one
- allow user to select their own quality after answering (in case they wanna move it up or down a slot)?
