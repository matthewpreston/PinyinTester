- modify card feature during testing phase
- go back to previous card that was tested
    - maybe even have it be a large list so you can keep going back in time like how Anki does
- number of dots to display which shows what level of QUALITY one got for answering kinda like how Anki does
- deleted card graveyard revival
- make a .ini file to remember the state of what the user wants to test
    - test if .ini is blank/None, then go to default
